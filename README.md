# PP2_Assignment4
An Assignment where we were given the Player and Roster classes and a roster input file and needed to pull players with notable statistics out of the roster and print their information. We also used JOptionPane to have a basic GUI.


Made in Eclipse/Java, src will be the raw code, bin is compiled.
